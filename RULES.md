# Dice Game Rules

## Passe-dix (Passage / Paschen)

**Sources:** Cotton, The Compleat Gamester, historical lexicons, games.porg.es, Dice-Play (“Ten” variant), Wikipedia

**Players:** 3 standard dice, banker (bank) and one or more punters

**Setup:**
- Banker sets the initial bank (stake).
- Players may cover the bank with bets up to the bank amount.

**Play:**
- Banker rolls all three dice repeatedly until a double (two dice showing the same number) appears.
- When a double appears, sum all three dice:
    - If the sum is **11 or more** (“passe”): banker wins, takes all bets.
    - If the sum is **3–10** (“non passa”): punters win, paid 1:1 from the bank.
- If a triple (e.g., 1-1-1, 2-2-2, etc.) is rolled, re-roll (no result).
- After a loss, the banker role may pass to the next player (traditional variant).

**Note:** Historical sources report minor variants; above is the most common modern rule.

## Hazard

**Sources:** Hoyle tradition (18th–19th c.), encyclopedic summaries, Wikipedia

**Players:** 2 dice, caster (roller) vs. bank/setter

**Setup:**
- Caster declares the “main” (a number from 5 to 9).
- Caster rolls both dice.

**First Roll Outcomes:**
- Main appears: “nick” (caster wins).
- 2 or 3: “out” (caster loses).
- 11 or 12: depends on main:
    - Main 5 or 9: 11 and 12 lose.
    - Main 6 or 8: 11 loses, 12 wins.
    - Main 7: 11 wins, 12 loses.
- Any other 4–10 becomes the “chance.”

**After First Roll (if chance is set):**
- Caster keeps rolling until either:
    - Chance appears (caster wins), or
    - Main appears (caster loses).
- 2 or 3 always lose, at any time.

**Dice pass:** Traditionally, caster keeps dice until losing three times in a row, then passes left.

## Astronomical (Astrological) Chess

**Source:** Libro de los Juegos (Alfonso X, 1283), Wikipedia

**Players:** 7 players, circular zodiac board, 7-sided die (modern: use 1d8, ignore one result), stakes

**Setup:**
- Each player is assigned a planet/celestial body by lot (1d7): Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon.
- Each starts on a zodiac sign specific to their orbit.

**Play:**
- First player determined by 1d7 roll.
- On each turn, roll 1d7 and move counterclockwise along orbit.
- Payments occur when entering certain angular relations (“aspects”) with other pieces:
    - Sestile (±2 sectors): collect 2/12 from counterpart(s).
    - Quadrature (±3): pay 3/12.
    - Trigone (±4): collect 3/12.
    - Opposition (±6): pay 6/12.
    - Conjunction (same sector): pay 12/12 (full stake).
- Modern editions use reconstructed boards; payment ratios are from the original text.

## Poker Dice

**Sources:** Modern practice, dicegamedepot.com, Wikipedia

**Players:** 5 poker dice (faces: 9, 10, J, Q, K, A), optional chips

**Objective:** Achieve the best poker-style combination in up to 3 rolls.

**Turn:**
1. Roll all 5 dice.
2. Set aside any dice (may change choice later).
3. Second and optional third roll, rerolling any subset.
4. Declare final combination.

**Hand Rankings (high to low):**
- Five of a kind
- Four of a kind
- Full house (3+2)
- Straight (e.g., 9-10-J-Q-K or 10-J-Q-K-A; usually not 9-10-J-Q-A)
- Three of a kind
- Two pair
- One pair
- High card

**Notes:**
- Some sets treat aces as high; no flushes.
- Betting: ante + single bet, or simplified poker rounds. Family versions may use points (e.g., Five of a kind = 50, Four = 40, etc.).
